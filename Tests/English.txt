Class RepeatCounter
Method CountRepeats(string sentence, string word)

Test a single word, input "word", "word". Output 1.
This is the simplest way to test this function because there is only one input word.

Ignore other words. Input "This word", "word". Output 1.
Simplest input because only contains one match
This can be done using a simple indexof or contains, because it still only contains one match

Count multiple words. Input "This word word", "word". Output 2.
Simplest input because matching two exact words
This can be done by wrapping previous if in a loop iterating over the string broken up by spaces.

Don't count partial matches. Input "this wordy word", "word". Output 1.
simplest input because matching one word while ignoring one partial
A simple if statement change can correct this

Be case insensitive. Input "Word wordy word", "word". Output 2.
Simplest next step because taking into account one way to break it at a time, in this case case sensitivity
Change the conditional again and bring both cases to lower.

Don't include punctuation. Input "Word wordy word.", "word". Output 2.
Simplest next step because taking into account one way to break it at a time, in this case punctuation
Change the conditional to include something to strip punctuation out of the tested sentece.

Last test. Input "'tEsT. sentence is tEsTing the ?tEsT' a bility of tEsTing the program that tEsTs for string [tEsT] occurances in tEsT; string tEsTy tEsT^ 'tEsT.", "test". Output 7
This is not simple. Its trying to break the program.
